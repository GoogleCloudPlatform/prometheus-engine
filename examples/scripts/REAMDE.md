This directory contains example scripts one could write for useful operations on GMP data, using programmatic Go SDK.

Scripts are in form of separate, single Go files. You can run them using `go run <dir>/<file> -help`. 

> WARNING: Those are only examples, those scripts might be or might not be thoroughly tested. Use with care and only after reading the code.
