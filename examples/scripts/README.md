This directory contains example scripts one could write for useful operations on
Managed Service for Prometheus data, using the programmatic Go SDK.

Scripts are in the form of separate, single Go files. You can run them using `go run <dir>/<file> -help`. 

> WARNING: These are only examples, these scripts might be or might not be thoroughly tested. Use with care and only after reading the code.
