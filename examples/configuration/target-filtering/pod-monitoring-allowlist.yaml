    # to configure and safer to control and test. Recommended filtering method per pod.

      # Only collect series having pod label prefix `prom-example-` and
      # name 'go_goroutines' or prefix 'example_random_numbers_'. The last
      # metric name is a classic histogram, which consists of 3 metric names:
      # example_random_numbers_bucket, example_random_numbers_count, example_random_numbers_sum.
      #
      # NOTE: Be wary of the typical misconfiguration for the regex like
      # example_random_numbers_(bucket|count) to match example_random_numbers
      # classic histogram or to match exactly one example_random_numbers_sum series.
      # Because example_random_numbers is a classic histogram, filtering of
      # any series that belong to a single histogram will filter out
      # the whole histogram (partial histograms are rejected). Using catch all
      # suffix regex is recommended.
