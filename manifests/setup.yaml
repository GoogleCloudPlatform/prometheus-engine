                    Specifically, this prevents scraping Succeeded pods from K8s jobs, which
                    could contribute to noisy logs or irrelevant metrics.
                    Additionally, it can mitigate issues with reusing stale target
                    labels in cases where Pod IPs are reused (e.g. spot containers).
