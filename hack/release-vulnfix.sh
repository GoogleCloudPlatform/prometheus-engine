usage: ${me}

Attempt a minimal dependency upgrade to solve fixable vulnerabilities.

NOTE: The script is idempotent; to force it to recreate local artifacts (e.g. local clones, remote branches it created), remove the artifact you want to recreate.

Example use:
 * BRANCH=release/0.15 CHECKOUT_DIR=~/Repos/tmp-release ${me}
 * BRANCH=release-2.45.3-gmp CHECKOUT_DIR=~/Repos/tmp-release ${me}
 * BRANCH=release-0.27.0-gmp CHECKOUT_DIR=~/Repos/tmp-release ${me}

Variables:
* BRANCH (required) - Release branch to work on; Project is auto-detected from this.
* CHECKOUT_DIR (required) - Local working directory e.g. for local clones.
* PR_BRANCH (default: USER/BRANCH-vulnfix) - Upstream branch to push to (user-confirmed first).
