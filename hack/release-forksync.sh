usage: ${me}

Create a new release of fork against an upstream version (tag) while carrying the patches from the
previous fork version. The process involves an "semantic fork git rebase -i" flow, similar to the normal git rebase -i (see semantic_fork_rebase for details).

NOTE: The script is idempotent; to force it to recreate local artifacts (e.g. local clones, remote branches it created), remove the artifact you want to recreate.

Example use:
* SOURCE_BRANCH=release-2.45.3-gmp UPSTREAM_TAG=v2.53.5 CHECKOUT_DIR=~/Repos/tmp-release bash ${me}

Variables:
* CHECKOUT_DIR (required) - Local working directory e.g. for local clones.
* SOURCE_BRANCH (required) - Fork branch considered as a source for the forked changes. This branch will be semantically rebased on UPSTREAM_TAG.
* UPSTREAM_TAG (required) - Upstream tag to synchronize (rebase) to; this also controls the name of the eventual branch to use for the sync (release-$UPSTREAM_TAG-gmp).
* PR_BRANCH (default: $USER/cut-release-$UPSTREAM_TAG-gmp) - Upstream branch to push to.
