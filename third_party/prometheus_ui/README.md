This directory contains a vendored version of the React UI of the Prometheus project
(https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and a set of modified files.
Building the union of both creates a subset of the upstream UI with only the graphing
page being accessible.

## How to modify sync and use it

Refer to [pkg/ui/README.md](/pkg/ui/README.md) for detailed instruction before
touching this directory.
