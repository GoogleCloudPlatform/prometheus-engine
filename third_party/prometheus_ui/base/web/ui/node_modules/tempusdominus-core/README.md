# Tempus Dominus Core
![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tempusdominus%2Fcore.png)

# Version 5
This is the Core component of the new Version 5. This is a "scorched earth" version and there are **a lot** of breaking changes.

The new picker under the "Tempus Dominus" brand will be completely modular. The goal is to separate the core functions into its own library with specific modules for Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, and possibly other UI frameworks.

This new version has been completely rewritten in ES6 and uses Babel to transpile the code down.

The code base here is in need of clean up. I have lots of leftovers from the previous project and I'm playing around with grunt and the build process to find what works best.
