This repository contains various binaries and packages for client-side usage
of Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus (GMP), a managed Prometheus offering on top
of Google Cloud Monitoring (GCM).

For more documentation and to get started, go to [g.co/cloud/managedprometheus](https://g.co/cloud/managedprometheus).

## Binaries

* **[config-reloader](cmd/config-reloader)**: An auxiliary binary to initiate reload on configuration file changes.
* **[frontend](cmd/frontend)**: An authorizing proxy for the Prometheus-compatible query API of GMP. It additionally hosts a query UI.
* **[operator](cmd/operator)**: A Kubernetes operator for managed metric collection for GMP.
* **[rule-evaluator](cmd/rule-evaluator)**: A Prometheus rule evaluation engine that evaluates against GMP.

For the fully Prometheus-compatible binary that writes ingested data into GMP/GCM,
see [GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/prometheus).

## Docker Images

Images for this repo are regularly released [in the GKE release GCR](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gke-release/global/prometheus-engine).

## Build

Run `make help` shows a list of candidate targets with documentation.

Any go application in `./cmd/` with an associated `main.go`, e.g. `./cmd/operator/main.go`
is a candidate for build by running:
```bash
make operator
```

- Running `make bin` will generate all the go binaries.
  - Setting `NO_DOCKER=1` here will build all the binaries natively on the host machine.
- Running `make test` will run unit and e2e tests.
  - If `NO_DOCKER=1` is set, end-to-end tests will be run against the current
  kubectl context. It is assumed the cluster has access to the GCM API.
  Ensure `GMP_CLUSTER` and `GMP_LOCATION` are set, e.g.
  ```bash
  NO_DOCKER=1 GMP_CLUSTER=<my-cluster> GMP_LOCATION=<cluster-location> make test
  ```
- Running `make presubmit` will run various checks on the repo to ensure it is
ready to submit a pull request. This includes testing, formatting,
and regenerating files in-place.
  - Setting `DRY_RUN=1` won't regenerate any files but will return a
  non-zero exit code if the current changes differ from what would be. This
  can be useful in running in CI workflows.
